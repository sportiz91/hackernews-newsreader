# Hacker News Reader App - Create React App

This App is done using React. In this case, I used `create-react-app` + [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). The goal of this project was to practice even more my React skills and consuming data from APIs. In the road, I learnt lots of valuable things of different topics. See below!

# Next Steps

Nope :). Everything's done!

# Learnings

- ## Global Learnings:
      * More practice into React, Basic Hooks (useState, useEffect), Components & Props.
      * Create-react-app basic setup: Web App Manifest, Public Folder, Meta Theme Color, Service-Workers/ReportWebVitals, ...
      * Fragments in React.
      * Diffing Algo React (how React render components): Virtual vs Real DOM, re-render on virtual DOM vs actualization on Real DOM (really understood how React actually works "under the hood").
      * Understanding key props in depth.
      * Rule of Hooks / eslint plugin.
      * async/await in depth.
      * BLOB object.

      * Debouncing functions.

- ## LAST BUT NOT LEAST... TESTING!!!!!!!!!!!
  - Unit Testing vs Integration Testing vs E2E Testing.
  - React Testing Library
  - Jest
  - Basic Cypress (not done Cypress tests in this project, but as part of the Testing learnings, I saw some tutorials on Cypress too. Looking to add more projects about testing in near future).
